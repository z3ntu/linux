* GPIO vibrator device tree bindings

Registers a GPIO device as vibrator, where the vibration motor just has the
capability to turn on or off. If the device is connected to a pwm, you should
use the pwm-vibrator driver instead.

Required properties:
- compatible: should contain "gpio-vibrator"
- enable-gpios: Should contain a GPIO handle

Optional properties:
- vcc-supply: Phandle for the regulator supplying power

Example from Fairphone 2:

vibrator {
	compatible = "gpio-vibrator";
	enable-gpios = <&msmgpio 86 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	vcc-supply = <&pm8941_l18>;
};
